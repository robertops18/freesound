# Freesound Beast Whoosh Front end development

## Installation

Checkout the Freesound repository and run this command from the root folder:

```
npm install
```


## How to run frontend "demo"

Run this command from the root folder:

```
npm start
```

You will be prompted the choose which page to start (use the arrow keys to pick your choice).
Once you select, open the browser at `http://localhost:1234` in order to see that page.
So far, there are work in progress versions of the front page and the search page.


## Icons

This project uses https://icomoon.io for generating the icon font.
To import the font project in your own icomon account (a free one is enough), import the file `bw-icons/selection.json`, as explained in the `bw-icons/Read Me.txt` file.
